# Harvard Summer School: Pre-College Program

This course is an introduction to programming methods, as they pertain to numerical solutions to the astrophysics problem of motion under the influence of multiple gravitating bodies and the visualisation of this information. The increasing prevalence of massive data sets and falling computational barriers have rendered computational modelling and data visualisation necessary in most of the contemporary sciences. With this in mind, this course prepares students to select and properly undertake commonly encountered modelling and visualisation tasks. This course first teaches relevant concepts from programming using hands-on activities. Students then apply their new programming skills to guided problems of orbital motions of multiple planetary systems (like that around our Sun and other stars) and end the course with both two and three dimensional interactive movies of their data sets.
